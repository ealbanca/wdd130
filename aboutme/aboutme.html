<h1> About Me </h1>
<h2> Hared Albancando Robles </h2>

<p> Hi everyone, My name is Edwin Hared, I'm from Colombia and I'm so excited to learn about web fundamentals.
</p>

<p> I got married almost three years ago to a beutiful woman. We adopted two dogs earlier this year and we have enjoyed training them. I love watching and playing soccer. I will be reaching out to some of you, since I'm new on this adventure.  
</p>
